# Real Time Bus Tracker
Tracking of MBTA 1 Busses between MIT and Harvard

## Description of the project
Pulls GPS locations for Route 1 busses from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). Busses are color-coded depending on direction, with <span style="color:blue">blue busses headed South</span> and <span style="color:red">red busses headed North</span>. Occupancy status (how full the bus is) is available by clicking the marker.

Bus locations are automatically updated every 15 seconds.

## How to Run
Download all files then open index.html in your browser

## Roadmap of future improvements
Occupancy status can be shown via changing the opacity of the marker

Showing "time until the next bus arrives" for each of the bus stops
